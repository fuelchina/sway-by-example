# Control Flow - While Loop

In Sway, while loops, continue, and break are key concepts for controlling loop structures.
1. **while Loops (While Loops)**:
   - while loops allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is no longer true.
   - In the `example_1` function, we use a while loop to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 5.
2. **continue and break**:
   - The continue statement allows you to skip the remaining part of the current loop iteration and start the next iteration.
   - The break statement allows you to completely exit the loop, skipping the remaining part of the loop.
   - In the `example_2` function, we use a while loop and continue to calculate the sum of odd numbers from 1 to 5.
   - In the `example_3` function, we use a while loop and break to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 3.

In the provided code, we define a smart contract named `MyContract` with three functions named `example_1`, `example_2`, and `example_3`, each returning a `u64` type value.
- The `example_1` function uses a while loop to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 5.
- The `example_2` function uses a while loop and continue to calculate the sum of odd numbers from 1 to 5.
- The `example_3` function uses a while loop and break to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 3.

The `example_1`, `example_2`, and `example_3` functions of this smart contract return 15, 9, and 6, respectively. This simple example is intended to show you how to use while loops, continue, and break in Sway to control loop structures. We hope this tutorial helps you better understand these control structures in Sway.
