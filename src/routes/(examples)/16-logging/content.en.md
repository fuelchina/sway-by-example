# Logging

In Sway, logging is an essential feature that allows smart contracts to record information during their execution. These logs can be used for debugging, auditing, or monitoring the behavior of smart contracts.

In the provided code, we define a smart contract named `MyContract` with a function called `test_func` that accepts a string of length 4 as a parameter.
- We use the `use` statement to import the `std::logging` module, which provides logging functionality.
- In the `test_func` function, we call the `log` function and pass the incoming string as the log message.

The `test_func` function of this smart contract will record the incoming string as a log message when executed. This simple example is intended to show you how to use logging in Sway to record the behavior of smart contracts. We hope this tutorial helps you better understand the logging feature in Sway.
